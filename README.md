he purpose of the project is to collect, work and clean a data set. the data is Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
Download the data from: [Link] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
Unzip the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory "./data"
Read training tables,testing tables, features and activityLabels
Assign colunm names for XTrain,Xtrain from features[,2],
Assign activityId as cloumn name for Ytrain, yTESt _ Merge the train and the test tables (mrgTrainAndTest)
2- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Create columnsToKeep,vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
3- Making subset from mrgTrainAndTest with just the columns to keep
Create subset( MeanAndStdTable) from the merging set( mrgTrainAndTest) with just the columns to keep
4- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge the subset( MeanAndStdTable) with activityLabels by activityId' _ Get rid of the column activityId
5- Making second tidy data set
Create a tidy data set with with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Writing tidy data in tidy.text
